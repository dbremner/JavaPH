SYNTAX: passwd [alias-of-other-user]

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "passwd" command is used to change your Nameserver password.  To
use it, simply type, "passwd".  You will be asked to enter your new
password two times.

<P>
You must be logged in to the Nameserver to use the "passwd" command
(see help on "login").

<P>
If you are proxy to another user, you may change his or her password by
specifying the appropriate alias to the passwd command; for example, if
you are proxy to John Doe's entry and John's alias is "j-doe1", you
could change his password while logged in to your own entry by typing
"passwd j-doe1".

<P>
<STRONG>GOOD PASSWORDS</STRONG><BR>
Good passwords are at least six characters long and contain a wide
variety of characters.  Ph will complain if your password is too short
or contains only numbers.

<P>
It is best to avoid names or any word from the dictionary.  One good
scheme for passwords is to make them acronyms for some phrase you can
remember.  For example, you might think of "a rose By any other name
would smell..." and use "arBaonws" as your password.
