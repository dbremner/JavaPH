SYNTAX: help [native] name-of-topic...

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "help" command gives help on Nameserver commands and concepts.  You
can obtain a list of help topics by simply typing the word "help".

<P>
You will notice that the list of topics is divided into two parts, "ph"
help topics and "native" help topics.  The "ph" help topics pertain to
commands and concepts related to the Unix ph client and other clients
similar to it.  The "native" topics may of interest to anyone using the
Nameserver database and are not specific to a particular client.

<P>
If you ask for help on a topic, "help" will first look for that topic
in the "ph" topics.  If there is no help specific to "ph" for the topic,
it will look for a "native" help topic with that name.

<P>
In the rare event that there you are interested in reading the "native"
help text for a topic that also has a "ph" help text, you can type:
"help native name-of-topic-you-want".

<P>
If you find the concept of "ph" versus "native" help to be confusing,
the following categorization of the ph help topics may be of use to you.
The list below assigns each topic to one of five main subject areas:
commands, concepts, fields, services, codes, and miscellaneous:
