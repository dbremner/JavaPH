SYNTAX: switch [-rRmMbBlLT] [-t name-of-type]

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "switch" command is used to change ph switches during a session; it
can also be used to view the current switch settings.  Switches exist
to control the following things:

 
<P>
  Reformatting   - whether or not ph reformats alias and email information.
<PRE>
                   The -R switch turns this ON (the default);
                   -r turns it OFF.

  Paging         - whether or not ph uses a paging program for its output. 
                   The -M switch turns this ON (the default);
                   -m turns it OFF.
</PRE>

<P>
  Beautification - whether or not ph beautifies the results of queries.
<PRE>
                   The -B switch turns this ON (the default);
                   -b turns it OFF.

  Labelling      - whether or not ph prints labels for fields.
                   The -L switch turns this ON (the default);
                   -l turns it OFF.

  Type           - what entry type ph uses by default.
                   The -T switch turns this OFF (the default);
                   "-t name-of-type" turns it ON.  Turning it on
                   has the same effect as adding "type=name-of-type"
                   to every query.  The default type can be overridden
                   when turned on by specifying a type.  See "type"
                   for further explanation.
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>VIEWING SWITCH SETTINGS</STRONG><BR>
You must be in ph's interactive mode to use the "switch" command.  To
view the current settings, just type "switch" with no arguments at the
"ph&gt;" prompt.  You will get a display similar to:

<P>
  ph&gt; switch<BR>
The following things can be changed with "switch":

<P>
  Paging is ON; use "switch -m" to turn it off.
  Email reformatting is ON; use "switch -r" to turn it off.
  Query beautification is ON; use "switch -b" to turn it off.
  Label printing is ON; use "switch -l" to turn it off.
  Edit confirmation is OFF; use "switch -C" to turn it on.
  Default entry type is OFF; use "switch -t name-of-type" to set
  it to "name-of-type".<BR>
  Default field list is default; use "switch -f field1,field2,..."
  to set it to "field1,field2,...".

<P>
The following things cannot be changed with "switch":

<P>
  Connected to server ns.cso.uiuc.edu at port 26880
  The .netrc file was read.

<P>
(Note that the .netrc, Server, and Port options cannot be controlled
from inside ph.  They are available, however, when typing ph commands
from the operating system prompt [command mode].)

<P>
SETTING SWITCH SETTINGS (say that three times fast)
Switch settings are made just like on the command line; one or more
switches preceded by hyphens.  For example, to turn Paging OFF, type:

<P>
  ph&gt; switch -m<BR>
  ph&gt;

<P>
Changes in ph switch settings are only in effect for the current
interactive session.  Once you exit ph, they return to their default
settings.
