SYNTAX: login [your-alias]

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "login" command allows you to identify yourself to the Nameserver.
More specifically, it identifies you with a particular entry in the
Nameserver and allows you to change the fields in that entry and in any
other entry for which you have proxy rights (see help on "proxy").  It
is also necessary to be logged in to the Nameserver to view certain
sensitive fields in your own entry.

<P>
In order to use the "login" command, you must know both your ph alias
and your ph password.  Your can find out your alias by doing a ph lookup
on your own entry.  For example, if Paul Pomes wanted to learn his alias,
he could type "ph paul pomes" at the command prompt or in ph's interactive
mode.  Paul's ph entry would be displayed as follows:

<HR>
<PRE>
           name: pomes paul
          phone: (217) 333-6262
        address: 1429 dcl, MC 256
               : 1304 w springfield
               : urbana, il 61801
     department: computing services office
          title: sr res programmer
       email to: p-pomes@uiuc.edu (paul@uxc.cso.uiuc.edu)
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
The "alias" is the first item in the "email to:" line, before the
"@uiuc.edu"; thus, Paul Pomes' alias is "p-pomes".

<P>
To obtain your ph password, bring a valid University ID to the CCSO
Accounting and Distribution Office, 1420 DCL, 1304 W.  Springfield,
Urbana.

<P>
<STRONG>EXAMPLE</STRONG><BR>
Once you know your ph alias and password, you can login to the
Nameserver.  In order to login, you must first enter ph's interactive
mode by typing "ph" at the command prompt. Then type "login your-alias",
after which you will be prompted for your password.  Paul Pomes' "login"
session would look something like this:

<P>
  % ph<BR>
  [ph status message appears here]<BR>
  ph&gt; login p-pomes<BR>
  Enter nameserver password: [paul's-secret-password]
  200:p-pomes:Hi how are you?<BR>
  ph&gt;

<P>
Paul enters his Nameserver password when asked for it; his password is
not echoed to the screen.

<P>
<STRONG>NOTES</STRONG><BR>
If you are using ph from the account listed in your "email to:" line,
you will not have to give a password when logging into ph.  This feature
will only work if your system administrator has installed ph 5.0 or
later and has made it a privileged program.

<P>
If you do not give your alias on the command line, ph will ask you for it.

<P>
Some ph clients display the user "alias" as a separate field during a
lookup, rather than combining it with contents of the "email" field in
the "email to:" line.
