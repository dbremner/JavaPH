SYNTAX: logout

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "logout" command allows a user who is logged in to the Nameserver
to logout.  Once a user is logged out, ph will no longer execute commands
requiring a login such as "me", "edit", "make", etc., but it will respond
to queries.

<P>
"Logout" differs from the "quit" command in that "logout" leaves the
user in ph's interactive mode, while "quit" exits ph entirely.  If you
want to simultaneously logout and exit ph, use "quit" instead of "logout".

<P>
SEE ALSO: login, quit
