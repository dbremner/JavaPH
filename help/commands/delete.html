SYNTAX: delete [name-of-field=]value-of-field...

<P>
<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
This command is used to delete entire entries from the Nameserver
database.  Most users are not allowed to use this command.  Note that
it deletes ENTRIES; to delete a FIELD from an entry, use the "edit"
command.

<P>
You must be logged in and have special privileges to use "delete".

<P>
The arguments to the "delete" command are the same as the selection part
of a "query" command.  "Delete" finds all the entries that match the
argument(s) and deletes them.

<P>
The "delete" command obeys the Nameserver "limit" option, which can be
used to prevent deletion of more entries than intended.  To change the
limit option from its default of 2 to a smaller or larger number, type
the command "set limit=#", where "#" equals the maximum number of
entries that can be deleted.  If your intention is to delete one
specific entry, the safest method is to use the "alias" field specifier
in the argument; e.g., "delete alias=alias_of_entry_to_be_deleted".
