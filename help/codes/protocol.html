<P>
Introduction

<P>
This document describes the protocol used by the CCSO Nameserver.
It provides all the information necessary to write a program that
interfaces with the Nameserver, or for a human to speak directly
to the Nameserver.

<P>
While CCSO provides a client program for our Nameserver, we also
expect the Nameserver to be used from programs other than this
client.  First, our client does not run on every system.
Secondly, the Nameserver is potentially of use for more than just
human lookup of information; other programs (such as mail
delivery agents) may wish to use the Nameserver.

<P>
This was kept in mind when designing the protocol used by the
Nameserver.  It is fairly easy to generate and parse (if not
totally regular), and should prove easy to incorporate in any
program.

<P>
General Format

<P>
The general format of the protocol is request/response, like that
of FTP;[1] the client makes requests, and the server responds to
them.  The conversation is in "netascii", with a carriage

<HR>
<P>
   [1]  See  RFC-959, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), J. Postel and
J. Reynolds.


<P>
return-linefeed pair[2] separating the lines, as in telnet.[3]
This allows a user to use the Nameserver with any telnet client,
if they wish.

<P>
A request begins with a keyword, and may have zero or more keywords 
or values, separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines, and followed 
by a carriage return-linefeed pair.  Values containing
spaces, tabs or newlines should be enclosed in double quotes
(`"').  Any printable characters may be used in a quoted string
(except `"').  In addition, the sequences "\n", "\t", "\"", and
"\\" may be used to mean newline, tab, double quote, and
backslash, respectively.

<P>
Like FTP, numerical values are used to indicate the Nameserver's
response to requests.  Unlike FTP, data is passed on the same
connection as commands.  The format for responses is as follows:

<P>
     result code:[entry index:][field name:]text

<P>
Multiline responses should preface each line of the response with
the appropriate result code, negated (prefaced with "-"), on all
lines of the response but the last.  If a particular command can
apply to more than one entry, responses involving individual
entries will have an entry index directly following the result
code.  This index will begin with 1, and be incremented each time
a new entry is being referred to.  Commands that can apply to
more than one field will have the name of the field to which the
response applies directly following the entry index.  The text of
the response will be either an error message intended for human
consumption, or data from the Nameserver.  Whitespace (spaces or
tabs) may appear anywhere in the response.

<P>
Since more than one specific piece of information may be manipulated 
by a particular command, it is possible for parts of a command 
to succeed, while other parts of the same command fail.
This situation is handled as a single multi-line response, with
the result code changing as appropriate.

<P>
As for FTP, numerical responses are in the range 100-599 (or from
-599 to -100 for multiline responses), where the leading digit
has the following significance:

<OL>
  <LI> In progress
  <LI> Success
  <LI> More information needed
  <LI> Temporary failure; it may be worthwile to try again.
  <LI> Permanent failure

</OL>
<HR>
<P>
   [2] The carriage return is optional.
   [3] See RFC-854, Telnet Protocol Specification, J. Postel.


<P>
Specific numbers have meanings to some commands; all commands
obey the general scheme.

<P>
Many commands generate more than one line of response; every
client should be prepared to deal with such continued responses.
It is worthwhile to note that a command is finished when and only
when the result code on a response line (treated as a signed
integer) is greater than or equal to 200.

<P>
Keywords must be given in lower case; case in the values of
fields is preserved, although queries are not case-sensitive.

<P>
The Commands

<P>
query [field=]value. . .  [return field1 [field2]]
ph [field=]value. . .  [return field1 [field2]]

<P>
This is the basic client request.  It may be used in any of the
Nameserver modes.[4] Entries whose fields match the given values
will be found, and the requested fields printed.  If no field
name is specified in the query part of the command, the "name"
field is assumed.  If no fields are specified with a return
clause, a default set of fields will be returned.  Fields from
each entry will be prefaced with an entry index, a colon, the
field name, and another colon.  If the special field name "all"
is given in the return clause, all fields from the entry will be
printed (subject to normal constraints with regard to Nameserver
mode and field properties).

<P>
Note that to view some sensitive fields, it is necessary to use
Nameserver login mode.  Note also that fields whose descriptions
include the property Encrypt cannot be printed by the server.
Values containing newlines will be broken into lines and printed
one line per response.

<P>
The second number on each response is the entry index; it is
incremented each time the response refers to a new entry.

<P>
Some implementations of qi return a 102 response before the
actual entries, giving the number of entries found; be prepared
to see or not see this response.

<P>
"Query" and "ph" are synonyms.

<P>
    200:Ok.<BR>
    query dorner return alias hours
<PRE>
    -200:1:         alias: m-dorner
    -508:1:         hours: Not present in entry.

    -200:4:         alias: j-dorner1
    -508:4:         hours: Not present in entry.
</PRE>
<P>
    200:Ok.<BR>
    query alias=s-dorner return id<BR>
    -503:1:            id: You may not view this field.
    200:Ok.<BR>
    query name=dorner address=moon<BR>
    501:No matches to your query.

<P>
change [field=]value. . .  make field=value

<P>
Change looks much like query.  The entries to be changed are
specified as in query.  They keyword make separates the search
criteria from the fields to be changed.  The change command works
in hero mode, or in login mode if applied to fields whose
description contain the Change property[5] in the entry of the
logged-in user.  If it is desired remove a field, Adjacent double
quotes ("") should be given as the "new value" of the field.
Fields whose descriptions include the property Encrypted must be
encrypted before transmission to the Nameserver, unless the qi
program is being run directly from a terminal.  This encryption
should be done with the password of the logged in user.

<P>
Examples

<P>
    change alias=s-dorner make hours="when the sun shines"
    506:You must be logged in to use this command.
    change steven dorner make hours=""<BR>
    200:1 entry changed.<BR>
    change steven dorner make name="Dr. Strangelove"
    -505:name:you may not change this field.
    500:1 entry found, none changed.<BR>
    change ikenberry make email=zzz@xxx
    518:Too many entries (3) selected; limit is 2.
    change stanley ikenberry make email=zzz@xxx
    -510:s-ikenberry:You may not change this entry.
    500:1 entry found, none changed.

<P>
login alias<BR>
answer code<BR>
clear password

<P>
This is used to enter login or hero mode.  The Nameserver will
respond with a random challenge, which may be returned in
encrypted form via the answer command.  The encryption key will
be a password known to both the Nameserver and the user.  Alternately, 
the client may respond with the clear command, and give
the proper password in clear text.  This is not the recommended
method, and is only provided for the lazy protocol implementor.

<P>
Examples

<P>
    login s_dorner<BR>
    301:dkeiigjasdvvnmnmeigh<BR>
    answer ewituegndvbngkgdfkgl<BR>
    200:s-dorner:Hi how are you?<BR>
    login s-dorner<BR>
    301:?;_?DB,F9X;8O=H8Y&lt;H[H=FY?1*;&gt;?#(^='&lt;!HH
    answer ellwekkewdfasoiioiogdfkldfg<BR>
    500:Login failed.
