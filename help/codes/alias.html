<STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG><BR>
The "alias" field contains information that uniquely identifies a person
to the Nameserver.  Usually, the contents of the "alias" field consists
of a person's first initial, a hyphen, and complete last name.  For
example, "Paul B. Pomes" has an alias of "p-pomes".

<P>
Some people share the same first initial and last name; these people
typically have a number added to the ends of their aliases, so that
their aliases remain unique.  For example, "John Doe" might have an
alias of "j-doe1", and "Jane Doe" might have an alias of "j-doe2".

<P>
It is possible for the owner of a ph entry to change his or her alias
by logging into ph and using the "edit" or "make" command; thus, some
people have aliases that do not follow the conventions just described,
such as the alias "SueG".

<P>
<STRONG>RESTRICTIONS ON ALIASES</STRONG><BR>
If you decide to edit your alias field, you should be aware of certain
restrictions placed on the field:

<OL>
  <LI> The alias field is limited to the characters a-z (uppercase is
permitted, but ignored during ph lookups), 0-9, and the hyphen (-).

  <LI> The alias field must not contain a space.

  <LI> An alias must not be someone else's real name or nickname.

  <LI> The contents of the alias field must be unique; if you try to change
your alias to one already in use, ph will reject it.

</OL>
<P>
<STRONG>CHANGING YOUR ALIAS</STRONG><BR>
To change your alias, you must first login to ph.  Then use the "make"
or "edit" command to effect the desired changes:

<P>
<STRONG>EXAMPLES:</STRONG>

<P>
  make alias="PaulP"

<P>
  edit alias   (You will be placed in the default text editor, usually vi.
<P>
                Make the desired changes and save the file.)

<P>
If your change was successful, you should see the message:  "200:1 entry
changed".  If you violated one of the restrictions listed above, an
error message will appear.

<P>
For more information on the "alias" field and how it is used by the
Nameserver, see the ph help for "aliases" and "e-mail".
