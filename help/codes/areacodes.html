<STRONG>PH AREA CODE INFORMATION</STRONG>

<P>
The Nameserver database contains area codes for major cities and regions
in the U.S.  The ph area code information comes from an old, pre-existing
dataset and is only sporadically and haphazardly updated, so it may not
be entirely up to date.

<P>
<STRONG>EXAMPLES</STRONG><BR>
To find the area code for a particular U.S. city, set the "type" field
specifier to "areacode" followed the name of the city.  (Note: The "type"
field specifier [i.e. "type=areacode"] is not required, but its use in
the selection clause of the query will limit the search to those items
in the Nameserver database that are part of the area code dataset):

<P>
   ph&gt; ph type=areacode san francisco
<HR>
<PRE>
         name: area code 415
             : Oakland and San Francisco, (Bay Area)  California
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
The area code dataset does not include every city in the U.S.  If no
matching entries are found using the name of a city, try using the name
of the state instead, and the area codes for the major regions in the
state will be displayed:

<P>
   ph&gt; ph type=areacode new jersey
<HR>
<PRE>
         name: area code 201
             : Morristown,  and Newark, (Northeast) New Jersey
   ----------------------------------------
         name: area code 609
             : Atlantic City, Camden , and Trenton , (Southwest)
             : New Jersey
   ----------------------------------------
         name: area code 908
