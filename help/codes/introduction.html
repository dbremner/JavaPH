What is the CCSO Nameserver?

<P>
The CCSO Nameserver could be considered a database containing
information about people and things at the University of Illinois.  
It is designed to be extremely flexible in terms of the
information it keeps and also to provide fast access to that
information.  Currently, most of the information in the
Nameserver database comes from the University Student/Staff
Directory (the printed phone book).  The database also holds
several additional categories of information such as the complete
university course timetable for the fall, spring, and summer
semesters; a guide to local restaurants; area codes for major
cities and regions in the U.S.; up-to-the-hour weather condition
and forecast information for many Illinois cities and larger
metropolitan areas throughout the country; and special entries
created on request such as organizations within departments and
student clubs and groups.

   Converted to portable n/troff format using the -me macros from
funky Next WriteNow format (icch).


<P>
The CCSO Nameserver could also be regarded as a pair of programs:
one that manages the actual data (this program is called qi, for
query interpreter), and another program (or rather a group of
programs - one for each computing platform on the campus network)
that handles end-user requests.  The programs that handle user
requests are usually called ph (or ph clients), which stands for
phone book.  Because ph is the name of the software familiar to
most end-users, many people refer to the Nameserver itself as ph
or use the terms Nameserver and ph interchangeably.

<P>
Where is it?

<P>
The database for the Nameserver is installed on a VAXServer 3500
that runs the UNIX operating system (Ultrix 3.0); the name of
this CCSO computer is garcon.cso.uiuc.edu with the alias
ns.uiuc.edu.  The program that manages the database (qi) also
runs on this machine.  Qi allows programs running on other computers 
to access the database by serving as an intermediary
between them and the actual database.

<P>
The Nameserver functions on a "server-client" basis.  This means
that the database and query interpreter reside on a single computer 
(the VAXserver described above), which functions as the
"server".  Mainframes and desktop computers can transparently
access server data over UIUCnet, the campus network, using special 
software designed to communicate with the server.  Machines
running such software (and the end-user software itself) are typically 
referred to as ph "clients".  Ph client programs have been
developed for almost all of the mainframe and desktop computing
platforms and operating systems found on the UIUC campus including 
UNIX, VM/CMS, VMS, PC (DOS), Macintosh, Next, and X Windows.
Some of these clients were developed locally, while others have
been developed by programmers at other institutions.

<P>
A full-featured ph client is available on all CCSO-administered
UNIX computers.  A slightly less robust client can be found on
the CCSO IBM mainframe VMD.  Ph client software is also installed
on hundreds of desktop computers and workstations on the campus
network.  Client software for desktop computers such as IBM PCs
and Macs provides convenient access to server data without
requiring a mainframe account or special knowledge of an unfamiliar 
operating system or text editor.  For a list of ph clients
and information on where to get them, see ph's on-line help for
"clients".

<P>
What Services Does the Nameserver Offer?

<P>
The Nameserver can be used to find the phone numbers and
addresses of University faculty, students, and staff members,
just like the printed version of the Student/Staff Directory; but
the Nameserver is not a mere electronic copy of the campus phone
book.  For one thing, it contains the electronic mail addresses
for thousands of faculty, students, and staff.  It also includes
additional information about some individuals such as office
hours, birthdays, vacation plans, facsimile numbers, etc.  Information 
of the latter sort is usually entered manually by the
owner of the entry and is, thus, available for some people in the
database and not others.

<P>
The Nameserver also contains entire categories of information not
found in the Student/Staff Directory; e.g., weather conditions,
local restaurants, national area codes, the university course
timetable, etc.  For information on how to extract such information 
from the Nameserver, see ph's on-line help for "people",
"campus_units", "weather", "areacodes", "restaurants", and
"timetable".

<P>
A key thing to know about the Nameserver is that, if you use a
computer that has a full-featured ph client installed on it, you
can change the information the Nameserver keeps about you.  For
example, if your office address or phone number changes in the
middle of the year, you can put your correct address and phone
number in the Nameserver immediately so that people can use ph to
find up-to-date information about you.

<P>
Another very important function of the Nameserver is electronic
mail forwarding.  If you tell the Nameserver where you read your
electronic mail by recording this information in your "email"
field, then anyone wishing to send mail to you can send the mail
to alias@uiuc.edu, where alias is your Nameserver alias (a unique
name by which the Nameserver knows you, generally formed by your
first initial, a hyphen, and your full last name).  If someone
doesn't know your Nameserver alias, s/he can send mail to
your-name@uiuc.edu, and the Nameserver will try to find you.  In
either case, the Nameserver will send your mail to the address
listed in the "email" field of your nameserver entry.  For example, 
you can send mail to Steven Dorner (author of the UNIX ph
program) using the address: s-dorner@uiuc.edu ("s-dorner" is
Steve's Nameserver alias), or steven-dorner@uiuc.edu (Steve's
real-life name).  Either way, the mail will be forwarded by the
Nameserver to "dorner@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu", which is where Steve
currently reads his mail.  For more information on e-mail forwarding, 
see the ph on-line help for "e-mail".

<P>
Nameserver Restrictions and Limitations

<P>
There are some things the Nameserver is not meant to do.  One
thing that should be mentioned right away is that the Nameserver
can't be used to generate mailing lists for junk mail.  The
server is designed so that queries that generate more than 25
responses are refused.  So, you don't have to worry about getting
junk mail because you appear in the Nameserver's database.

<P>
Also, the Namserver cannot be used to notify the University about
changes of address, phone number, and/or other personal or official 
information about yourself.  Although you can change this
kind of information in your Nameserver entry, such changes are
not automatically sent to your department, the Office of Admissions 
and Records,  Payroll, or anywhere else.  You must notify
these offices individually by filling out the appropriate paperwork.
